# Decentralized Student Verification System

## Intro
In today's digital age, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of academic credentials is of paramount importance. Traditional methods of verifying student identities and educational achievements often involve cumbersome paperwork, centralized databases, and are susceptible to fraud and manipulation. The Decentralized Student Verification System addresses these challenges by leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and immutable platform for verifying student identities and academic credentials.

## What it does
The Decentralized Student Verification System allows educational institutions to register student identities and credentials on a blockchain network. It also enables third parties to verify these credentials securely and transparently.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MetaMask browser extension (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain in the browser)
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- Remix IDE (for smart contract development and deployment)

## Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KishoreRay/Decentralized_Student_Verification_System
   cd Decentralized_Student_Verification_System

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
      npm install

  
3. Compile and deploy smart contracts:
- Open Remix IDE and import the smart contracts from the `contracts` directory.
- Compile and deploy the contracts using Remix IDE.
- Note the contract address and ABI for later use.

4. Update the contract address and ABI in the JavaScript files where necessary.


5. Open the application in your browser and connect MetaMask to your local Ganache blockchain.

## Tools and Use
- **MetaMask Setup**: MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to interact with Ethereum-based applications directly in their browser. Install MetaMask and configure it to connect to your local Ganache blockchain for testing purposes.

- **Ganache**: Ganache is a local blockchain for Ethereum development. It provides a simulated environment where you can deploy and test smart contracts without interacting with the main Ethereum network.

- **Remix IDE**: Remix IDE is an online IDE for smart contract development and deployment. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and deploying Solidity smart contracts.

## Future Scopes
- Integration with real-world educational institutions for student identity verification.
- Enhanced security features using cryptographic techniques.
- Integration with other blockchain networks for interoperability.
